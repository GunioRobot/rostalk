Rostalk
=======

Rostalk is a <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> client implemented in Jtalk that used <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/rosbridge/Tutorials/Using%20Javascript%20to%20control%20ROS%20via%20rosjs">rosjs</a> (ROS javascript binding) and rosbridge. The main idea of Rostalk is to be able to develop and control robotic systems on the web with a high-level language like Smalltalk instead of using JavaScript.

Jtalk is an implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> language that runs on top of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">JavaScript</a> runtime. It is designed to make client-side development faster and easier. Jtalk is written in itself, including the parser and compiler. Jtalk compiles into efficient JavaScript, mapping one-to-one with the equivalent JavaScript. There is no interpretation at runtime.
